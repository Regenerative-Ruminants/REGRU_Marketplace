# PR #2: Add get_available_wallets command and frontend modal - Summary

**Original PR Link:** https://github.com/Regenerative-Ruminants/REGRU_Marketplace/pull/2

**Summary:**

This PR introduces a Tauri command `get_available_wallets` to fetch available wallet addresses and integrates a user interface element to display these wallets.

**Backend Changes (Rust - `src-tauri`):**

1.  **New Command `get_available_wallets`:**
    *   Created `src-tauri/src/commands/wallets.rs` to house the new Tauri command.
    *   The command `get_available_wallets` first checks for a wallet address in the `SECRET_KEY_ENV` environment variable.
    *   If not found in env, it attempts to load wallets from `.key` files in the `wallets/` directory (relative to the app's execution path or a standard config location, depending on Autonomi's fs resolution).
    *   Returns `Result<Vec<SerializableWallet>, String>`.
    *   Introduced `SerializableWallet { address: String }` for compatibility with Tauri's serialization.
    *   Error handling maps `color_eyre::Report` to `String` for the frontend.
2.  **Refactoring:**
    *   Moved wallet logic from the old `autonomi/access/wallets.rs` to the new `commands/wallets.rs`.
    *   Deleted `autonomi/access/wallets.rs` and updated `autonomi/access/mod.rs`.
3.  **Testing:**
    *   Added unit tests for `get_available_wallets` in `src-tauri/src/commands/wallets.rs`.
    *   Tests cover scenarios: env var present, env var absent (no files), and file-based wallets (though file-based loading part needs more robust testing based on actual Autonomi behavior).
    *   Network-dependent tests (`test_get_available_wallets_with_env_var`, `test_load_wallet_from_env_success`) are marked `#[ignore]` as they require a running Autonomi node.
    *   Corrected `test_get_available_wallets_without_env_var_no_files` to expect `Ok([])` when no wallets are found and no errors occur.
4.  **Documentation:**
    *   Added Rustdoc comments to `SerializableWallet` and `get_available_wallets`.
5.  **Compilation:**
    *   Fixed initial compilation errors related to module path and command naming.
    *   `cargo check` and `cargo test` (with ignored tests) pass in `src-tauri`.

**Frontend Changes (HTML/TypeScript - `src`, `index.html`):**

1.  **"Wallets" Button & Modal:**
    *   Added a "Wallets" button to the main navigation panel (`<nav id="first-panel">`).
    *   Clicking the "Wallets" button opens a modal dialog.
2.  **Modal Functionality (`src/app.ts`):**
    *   The modal invokes the `get_available_wallets` Tauri command.
    *   Displays the JSON result (list of wallets or error message) within the modal.
    *   Handles modal opening and closing (via close button or backdrop click).
3.  **Styling (`index.html` - Inline Styles):**
    *   The modal backdrop and panel are currently styled using **inline CSS styles** in `index.html`. This approach was adopted to ensure consistent rendering due to observed instability with the Vite dev server (e.g., "Port 1420 in use" errors, `ELIFECYCLE` crashes) potentially affecting CSS/Tailwind updates.
    *   The backdrop is a semi-transparent dark gray.
    *   The panel is a centered, fixed-width (500px) white box with padding, shadow, and border.
4.  **Original PR Goal:**
    *   The initial goal of logging wallets to the console (`console.log(await invoke("get_available_wallets"))`) is now superseded by displaying them in the modal.

**Testing Steps:**

1.  **Setup:**
    *   Ensure port 1420 is free.
    *   Run `pnpm install` if you haven't recently.
    *   Start the local Autonomi network: `./scripts/start-local-autonomi.sh`.
2.  **Run the App:**
    *   Execute `pnpm tauri dev`.
3.  **Verify Backend (No Environment Variable):**
    *   Without `SECRET_KEY_ENV` set and no `.key` files in `wallets/` (or wherever Autonomi looks for them by default), click the "Wallets" button in the app's navigation panel.
    *   **Expected:** The modal should open and display `[]` (an empty array) or an error if file system access fails.
4.  **Verify Backend (With Environment Variable):**
    *   Stop the app.
    *   Set the `SECRET_KEY_ENV` environment variable to a valid Autonomi secret key string. (e.g., `export SECRET_KEY_ENV="your_secret_key_here"` in your shell before running `pnpm tauri dev`, or use a `.env` file if the project supports it via `tauri-plugin-dotenv`).
    *   Run `pnpm tauri dev` again.
    *   Click the "Wallets" button.
    *   **Expected:** The modal should display the wallet address derived from `SECRET_KEY_ENV`, like `[ { "address": "0xYourWalletAddress" } ]`.
5.  **Verify Backend (File-Based - if applicable):**
    *   Ensure `SECRET_KEY_ENV` is unset.
    *   Place a valid `.key` file (e.g., `mywallet.key`) in the `wallets/` directory (you might need to create this directory at the root of the `src-tauri` folder or the project root, depending on where Autonomi searches. The `README.md` suggests `wallets/local.key` relative to project root).
    *   Run `pnpm tauri dev`.
    *   Click the "Wallets" button.
    *   **Expected:** The modal should display the wallet address(es) from the `.key` file(s).
6.  **Modal UI:**
    *   Verify the modal opens and closes correctly (using the close button and by clicking the backdrop).
    *   Verify the styling of the modal and backdrop appears as intended (semi-transparent dark backdrop, centered white panel with shadow and border).

**Potential Issues/Follow-ups:**

*   The dev server stability issues ("Port 1420 in use", `ELIFECYCLE` errors) should be investigated further. This might be affecting hot reloading and CSS updates.
*   Once server stability is confirmed, the inline styles for the modal in `index.html` should ideally be refactored back to Tailwind CSS classes for better maintainability and consistency.
*   The exact paths Autonomi uses for file-based wallet discovery should be confirmed to ensure robust testing of that scenario.
