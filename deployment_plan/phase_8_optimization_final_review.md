# Phase 8: Optimization, Final Review & Go-Live Prep

**Goal:** Optimize performance, refine logging and monitoring, conduct final reviews, and prepare for a stable "go-live" state of the web application.

---
## Stub P8.A: Performance Optimization

*   **P8.A.1:** **Backend Performance (Actix/Rust):**
    *   **P8.A.1.1:** Identify performance bottlenecks: Use profiling tools (`cargo flamegraph`, `perf`) for CPU-bound tasks or logging with timing for I/O-bound operations (especially Autonomi client calls).
    *   **P8.A.1.2:** Optimize database queries / Autonomi client interactions (e.g., selective data fetching, batch operations if supported by Autonomi).
    *   **P8.A.1.3:** Review Actix worker configuration. Default is usually fine, but can be tuned.
    *   **P8.A.1.4:** Consider asynchronous operations carefully; ensure no blocking calls on async executors.
    *   **P8.A.1.5:** Implement caching strategies (in-memory with `moka` or `cached` crates, or distributed like Redis) for frequently accessed, rarely changing data if Autonomi calls are slow.
*   **P8.A.2:** **Frontend Performance (TypeScript/Browser):**
    *   **P8.A.2.1:** Use browser developer tools (Lighthouse, Performance tab) to identify bottlenecks (rendering, script execution).
    *   **P8.A.2.2:** Optimize JavaScript bundle size (code splitting if app becomes very large, tree shaking is usually default with Vite/Rollup).
    *   **P8.A.2.3:** Optimize image sizes and formats. Use lazy loading for off-screen images.
    *   **P8.A.2.4:** Minify CSS and JS (usually handled by `pnpm build`).
    *   **P8.A.2.5:** Review data fetching strategies to avoid over-fetching or waterfalls.
*   **P8.A.3:** **Nginx Performance:**
    *   **P8.A.3.1:** Enable Gzip compression in Nginx for text-based assets (HTML, CSS, JS, JSON).
    *   **P8.A.3.2:** Configure browser caching headers in Nginx for static assets (`Cache-Control`, `Expires`).
    *   **P8.A.3.3:** Review Nginx worker processes and connections settings if under very high load.

## Stub P8.B: Logging, Monitoring, and Alerting

*   **P8.B.4:** **Structured Logging (Backend):**
    *   **P8.B.4.1:** Ensure consistent, structured logging (e.g., JSON format using `tracing-subscriber` with `tracing-bunyan-formatter` or similar for `tracing`, or `env_logger` with custom formatters).
    *   **P8.B.4.2:** Include relevant context in logs (request IDs, user IDs if applicable, source IP).
    *   **P8.B.4.3:** Adjust log levels for production (INFO for general, WARN/ERROR for issues).
*   **P8.B.5:** **Log Management & Analysis (Droplet/External Service):**
    *   **P8.B.5.1:** Set up log rotation on the server for Nginx and Actix application logs (`logrotate`).
    *   **P8.B.5.2:** (Optional) Consider shipping logs to a centralized logging service (e.g., ELK stack, Grafana Loki, Datadog, Sentry for errors) for easier analysis and alerting.
*   **P8.B.6:** **Basic Monitoring (Droplet):**
    *   **P8.B.6.1:** Monitor basic server metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network) using DigitalOcean dashboard or tools like `htop`, `vmstat`.
    *   **P8.B.6.2:** Monitor Actix application health (e.g., `/health` endpoint).
*   **P8.B.7:** **Error Tracking (Frontend/Backend):**
    *   **P8.B.7.1:** (Optional) Integrate Sentry or a similar service for capturing and reporting frontend JavaScript errors and backend Rust panics/errors.
*   **P8.B.8:** **Alerting (Future):** Set up alerts for critical errors, high server load, or application downtime.

## Stub P8.C: Final Code and Configuration Review

*   **P8.C.9:** **Code Review:**
    *   **P8.C.9.1:** Perform a final pass over the `src-backend` and modified `src` (frontend) code for clarity, consistency, and any remaining TODOs.
    *   **P8.C.9.2:** Ensure all dependencies are up-to-date and audited (`cargo audit`).
*   **P8.C.10:** **Configuration Review:**
    *   **P8.C.10.1:** Double-check all production environment variables (`.env` on server / GitHub Actions secret `BACKEND_ENV_PRODUCTION`).
    *   **P8.C.10.2:** Review Nginx configuration for correctness and security.
    *   **P8.C.10.3:** Review systemd service file for the backend.
*   **P8.C.11:** **Remove Debug Code:** Ensure no temporary debugging code, `println!` statements intended for dev, or overly verbose dev-time logging is present in production builds.
*   **P8.C.12:** **Documentation:** Update any internal documentation (READMEs, architecture docs) to reflect the web-deployed architecture.

## Stub P8.D: Backup and Recovery Plan (Conceptual)

*   **P8.D.13:** **Autonomi Network Data:** Understand backup/recovery mechanisms provided by or recommended for the Autonomi Network itself (this is likely external to your application code).
*   **P8.D.14:** **Server Configuration:** Backup critical server configuration files (Nginx configs, systemd units, `.env` file structure). This can be part of infrastructure-as-code or manual backups.
*   **P8.D.15:** **Application Code:** Versioned in Git.
*   **P8.D.16:** **Droplet Snapshots:** Regularly take snapshots of your DigitalOcean droplet as a full server backup.

## Stub P8.E: Go-Live Checklist

*   **P8.E.17:** All previous phases completed and reviewed.
*   **P8.E.18:** Domain name correctly pointed to droplet IP, HTTPS confirmed working.
*   **P8.E.19:** CI/CD pipeline deploys `web-deployment` (or a tagged release from it) reliably.
*   **P8.E.20:** Monitoring of basic health is in place.
*   **P8.E.21:** Key user flows tested on the live production environment.
*   **P8.E.22:** (Optional) Announce to stakeholders/users if applicable.
